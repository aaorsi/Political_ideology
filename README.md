 # Political ideology
At the moment, there are 3 datasets available to classify text:
- 3000 opinion articles from Salon.com (a liberal website)
- 5000 opinion articles from Townhall.com (a conservative website)
- 10000 posts from the political discussion forum liberalforum.net, where users identify their own political side and comment on a topic

The idea to use the first two sources comes from an article by Hao Yan et al. (https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/papers/political-orientation.pdf). The latter dataset was obtained from the github of `fedickinson`  (https://gist.github.com/fedickinson/0b0521be49297c5f058e78e6f5727241).
